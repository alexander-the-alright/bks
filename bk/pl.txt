Inspiration:: "HEY, YOU, POISON THE WELL" -FeedTheMachine, Poor Mans Poison

Setting:: Some sort of middle ages type deal. Swords and bows, crossbows even.
          Barbarian times? Follows a range of seasons

Main Idea:: Follows character A as he progresses on a journey from Place Aaa to
            Place Bbb, to kill the King, character B. Character A is accompanied
            by some sort of omniscient creature X that passes along wisdom and
            guidance. Creature X guides character A through n trials, but claims
            that A will face 2n trials. At each trial, X passes along a wisdom
            that helps A overcome the trial. The next chapter shows The King
            going through a similar type of trial, and making the opposite
            decision as A. The final trial of the King involves the King
            ordering an underling to poison the well, a way of making sure that
            a captor cannot adequately capture a territory, which selfishly
            guarantees sacrifice of the subjects, against their will. The final
            chapter, A rushes into a different kings throneroom, beheads the
            king, and is declared the new king, renamed as The King, the same
            character as that makes the wrong decisions at all the same trials.

                    "an archer sees everything as a target"?

                     world is why you do it"
                    "a man is the sum of his actions, weighted by his motives"
