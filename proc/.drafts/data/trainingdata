i am hammy the hamster
i live with my mother henrietta, my father harry,
my sister hachi and my brother hal

we live in south america
and you can't miss our home

it is the burrow under
the trees that look like the letter H

when we are out during the day, we are
very careful so we aren't caught

we might get trapped and become
someone's pet
so we are mostly out after dark

we like to eat seeds and fruit and can carry
it back home in our pouches
our cheeks have built in shopping bags

just like you we like to play and have fun

we have fun running into the light and
chasing our shadows on the leaves
last night hachi and i found this thing
when you pushed a button, it lit up like the sun

we like to climb things and explore

our cousings lester larry and lorain live in the city,
they are someone's pet
they sent us this picture and said they had
a lot of fun but missed playing with us

lester said he like people
he always had food and water and lots of toys to play with
he even likes to take a ride in the pocket of
his people friend, billy

i might be your pet some day, if i ever
become your pet, i hope you take good care
of me because i will do all i can to be your
friend. adios amigos
